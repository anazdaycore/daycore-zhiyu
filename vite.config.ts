// 纸屿 · 顺流 — the second of the four.

// # ⚠️ Unlike the console, this does NOT build into the Go binary
//
// web/console/vite.config.js points outDir at internal/resources/data/console
// because the console is version-locked to its backend and is needed exactly
// when things are broken. 汀 is the opposite on both counts: it talks to a
// backend it negotiates with at runtime (POST /api/version), and it is planned
// to become its own git submodule with its own release cadence
// (docs/ROADMAP.md 阶段 κ). Embedding it would re-tie the knot that separation
// exists to cut.
//
// So: a plain static build. Serve dist/ from anywhere.
//
// # base is './'
//
// Relative, because this build does not know its own URL. The console can hard
// code /admin/ since the Go server serves it there; 汀 may be at a domain root,
// a subpath, a CDN, or a file:// bundle inside a Capacitor shell. An absolute
// base would be a guess, and a wrong guess is assets that 404 — which looks
// exactly like a build that never happened.
